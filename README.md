## Project ##
The project consists of developing a **chatbot** that can respond not only to text messages, but also to audio messages. So if the user has any vision problem or something that makes it difficult to read, he can choose the audio service and the bot will proceed with the audio service. Our focus is to develop a product that pleases the business environment, through an API the robot can be applied in famous messaging applications or even on a company's own website, thus providing a more complete, technological and accessible automated service.


## Team ##
The team is made up of Brazilian students, where all are technology enthusiasts. On the team everyone is in their first degree in technology and already working as a developer. Two members of the team are part of the [Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors](https://studentambassadors.microsoft.com/) program and are super excited to add another integration of the program and the college into a single project.
